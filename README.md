## 📖 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from ai_literacy import AILiteracyPlatform, UserRole

# Initialize the platform
platform = AILiteracyPlatform()

# Create users
student = platform.create_user("john_doe", "john@example.com", UserRole.STUDENT)
teacher = platform.create_user("jane_smith", "jane@example.com", UserRole.TEACHER)

# Get a personalized learning path
learning_path = platform.get_personalized_learning_path(student.id)

# Update student progress
platform.update_progress(student.id, module_id, completion_percentage=75.0, time_spent=30)

# Get adaptive feedback
feedback = platform.get_adaptive_feedback(student.id, module_id, user_response)

# Access the teacher dashboard
dashboard = platform.get_teacher_dashboard_data(teacher.id)
```

### Data Persistence

```python
# Save platform data
platform.save_platform_data("my_school_data.json")

# Load platform data
new_platform = AILiteracyPlatform()
new_platform.load_platform_data("my_school_data.json")
```
